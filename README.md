automation tool --> selenium
testing framwork tool --> testng
design pattern --> page opject model 

I'm using selenium as an automation tool, TestNG as a testing framework, and a page object model design pattern, I built separate tests for each feature and built end-to-end scenario in the testng.xml file so if you want to see all the required steps run the tests from the TestNG   file
